These codes were used for the calculation of the electric signal in a semiconductor detector as a result of electron-hole pair liberation by an ionizing particle.

The theory of signal formation in a semiconductor particle detector is explained in texts like:

Semiconductor Detector Systems, Helmuth Spieler, Oxford University Press, 2005 (CH 1 and 2);

Particle Detectors: Fundamentals and Applications, Hermann Kolanoski, Norbert Wermes, Oxford University Press, 2020 (CH 3, 4, 5, 8, 17).

Details about the function themselves are given in the comments that accompany the code.

The pdf files provide some information about the the Weighting_field_calculation file and the Electric_field_calculation file
